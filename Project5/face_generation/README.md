# Project 5: Generate Faces

This is a project that I submitted for the Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree in 2017.

Topic: [Use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.](https://rbmayer.github.io/Udacity-Deep-Learning-Foundations-Nanodegree/Project5/face_generation/dlnd_face_generation.html)
